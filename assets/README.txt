# Required Assets

To complete the portfolio, you'll need to add the following image assets:

1. noise.png - A noise texture for the background effect
2. grid-bg.png - A grid pattern background (or use a dark tech background)
3. profile.jpg - Your profile picture (recommended size: 600x600px)

6. project3.jpg - Screenshot of your personal project (recommended size: 800x450px)

## Placeholder Images

Until you add your own images, you can use placeholder services like:

- https://picsum.photos/ (for project screenshots)
- https://placeholder.com/ (for specific size placeholders)
- https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ (for a random AI-generated face for profile)

## Fonts

If you want to use the custom cyberpunk font, please add a "Cyberpunk.woff2" file to the assets/fonts directory or update the CSS to use a different font.

## Noise Texture

For the noise texture, you can:
1. Create a noise texture in Photoshop or GIMP
2. Download a free noise texture from subtlepatterns.com
3. Generate one using a noise generator tool online

## Note

Without these assets, the website will still function but some visual elements may be missing or show as broken image links.
